# LibreELEC with Dolby Vision support for Intel and AMD iGPU

> Experimental branch: the [native source-domain engine](native-dv/README.md)
> and its [Kodi adapter source](native-dv/integration/README.md) are available
> for development. They are not yet enabled by a normal image build. The
> existing build and features described below remain separate from that work.

**R1.0.0 Beta1**

LibreELEC Generic x86_64 community build with Dolby Vision playback and HDR10
conversion in Kodi's native VideoPlayer.

Powered by **CB1 0.1**, an open-source Dolby Vision processing engine. No external
player or proprietary Dolby SDK is required or used.

## Dolby Vision profiles

| Profile | Support |
| --- | --- |
| 5 | Yes |
| 7 MEL | Yes |
| 7 FEL | Yes, including enhancement-layer reconstruction |
| 8.1 | Yes |
| 8.2 | Yes |
| 8.4 | Yes |
| 10 | Yes |
| 9, legacy profiles, 20 | No |

CM2.9 and CM4 metadata are supported. Full supported FEL reconstruction occurs
before conversion. Creative-control application depends on the selected mode
and the metadata present in the source.

## Playback controls

Settings are in **Player > Videos**. The selector shows modes for the current
source. Modes can change during playback.

With **Player information** enabled, press **O** to cycle:

1. Player information.
2. Quick rendering mode selection.
3. Video only.

Play/pause and seek remain available while either panel is open. Turning off
Player information restores Kodi's stock panel and disables the quick selector.
The optional startup mode notification is off by default.

### Player information

Video/audio source and output, DV profile and CM version, BL/EL/FEL state,
metadata blocks, active circuit, drops/skips and GPU render-engine usage.
HDR10 and SDR show their relevant fields without empty DV sections.

GPU usage measures Kodi's render engine, including visible GUI rendering,
not the whole GPU or video decoder. Playback diagnostics are recorded in `kodi.log`.

## Rendering modes by source

| Source | Mode | Output | Processing | TV profile |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dolby Vision | DV Standard (TV-Led) | DV | Reconstruct the image, including FEL; forward source DV metadata to the TV | Not required |
| Dolby Vision | DV Enhanced - Natural and Signature | DV | Adjust existing L2/L8 creative controls using the TV peak; two presets: Natural or Signature | Required |
| Dolby Vision | DV Disabled (native Kodi) | Native Kodi | Use Kodi's native playback without CB1 DV processing | Not required |
| Dolby Vision | HDR10 Reference Basic | HDR10 | Convert to HDR10 using L1 scene data and source mastering metadata | Not required |
| Dolby Vision | HDR10 Reference Expert | HDR10 | Map to the TV peak and gamut; apply available L2/L8 creative controls | Required |
| HDR10 | DV Reference (AI) | DV | Generate L1/L3 metadata with LightGBM; retain the HDR10 source pixels | Not required |
| HDR10 | DV Enhanced (AI) - Natural and Signature | DV | Map pixels to the TV peak and gamut, then generate DV scene metadata; two presets: Natural or Signature | Required |
| HDR10 | HDR10 Native | HDR10 | Use Kodi's native HDR10 playback | Not required |
| HLG / SDR | Native | HLG / SDR | Use Kodi's native HLG or SDR playback | Not required |

For more details, see [rendering modes and algorithms](docs/cb1/PROCESSING.md).
**DV/HDR10 enhanced and references rendering profile require a capable GPU** 

Standard Dolby Vision is the default. 
HDR10-to-Dolby Vision AI modes use the CB1-L1L3 0.1 LightGBM model included in CB1 and staged by the build.

### Quick settings

A compact bottom-right list shows the modes available for the current source.
Its height follows the number of modes. TV profile configuration stays in
Player settings.

## Known issues

- Some frame drops with Profile 7 FEL on a small number of files on N100/N150.

Report issues for this modified build here. Contact upstream projects only when
the issue also reproduces with their unmodified builds. No affiliation with or
certification by LibreELEC, Kodi, Dolby, Intel or AMD.
